            <h2 class="story-h2">If you ever plan a road trip from Lahore to Islamabad, make sure to make a stay at Kallar Kahar for an hour. </h2>

            <p class="ab-p">So, we continued our journey and reached Islamabad at 2:30 pm. As it was a family trip, we landed at our relative’s home. Since we had to visit many places, we made sure not to waste our time. We had some rest to recharge ourselves and woke up at 4:00 pm. And then we were ready to explore the beauty of Islamabad.
               First we went to Faisal Masjid. I always wanted to see this place, and this was the first time I was visiting it. So, I was overjoyed and overwhelmed to enter the mosque. </p>

        <div class="image-stories image2">
            <h2 class="story-h2"> Make sure to visit this place whenever you go to Islamabad.  </h2>
            <img src="./image/pic3.png" alt="">
            <p class="ab-p">After spending about 2 hours in the mosque, we went to the Rawal dam lake-view park of Islamabad. We enjoyed boating and the beautiful views were also worth watching in the evening. The park is best known for its beauty and elegance. Since I was with my family and cousins, I enjoyed this a lot at this recreational park. </p>

            <h2 class="story-h2">There is a famous restaurant Monal in Islamabad.  </h2>
            <img src="./image/pic1.png" alt="">
            <h2 class="story-h2">And the best view comes after the hardest climb  </h2>
            <p class="ab-p">When we reached there, the view was spectacular and attractive enough to capture all our attention. Imagine sitting in mountains, having your meal followed by a cup of tea. I have visited many restaurants in Lahore, but this experience was entirely different.  </p>

            <p class="ab-p">After spending some quality time at Monal, having lunch and tea, we aimed at coming back home. But wait. On our way back, we suddenly planned to visit Daman-e-Koh. Daman-e-Koh is on the way to Monal. So, here you go with a pro tip. Whenever you plan to visit Monal in Islamabad, spare some time to pay a visit to Daman-e-Koh especially in the evening. </p>
